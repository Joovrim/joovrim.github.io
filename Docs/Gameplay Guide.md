## Starting Out
When you first start a new game, you won't find yourself inside of Skyrim anywhere. Instead, you will be inside of the Realm of Lorkhan. This mod replaces the vanilla Skyrim intro with a most freestyle character creator, treat this like an extention of character creation, the game has not started yet, sure you can loot everything but then you may not have fun once you start.

*I'm sure you've seen the vanilla intro already, right?* 

The Realm of Lorkhan mod allows you to craft a character that can be allied with factions out of the gate, spawn with all sorts of different equipment, choose classes for your character and start in many different locations. Have a walk about, see what's around and available to you. Once you teleport at one of the crystals, you'll be dumped into Skyrim in the place you chose. Make your choices wisely though - once you leave, you cannot return.

## The Main Quest
There are no dragons until you start the main quest so you're free to roam in a (mostly) peaceful Skyrim. If you really, really want to do the main quest grab the Dragonstone from Bleak Falls Barrow or talk to Jarl Balgruuf in Whiterun.

## The World
Joovrim doesn't add much in terms of content unless a special profile is going on that offers it, it's Skyrim baby!

## Precision
Precision is a huge part of this modlist and one of the biggest departures from vanilla, weapon range is real and matters. Take that into account when making your character and choosing their equipment.
