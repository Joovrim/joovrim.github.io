# What is Joovrim?

Joovrim is a list based on Joov's typical go to mods when he starts a playthrough for his channel. Under special circumstances we may add specific profiles to emulate specific runs he has recently done but for the most part this list exists to be a Vanilla+ springing off point for your own list or just to play vanilla skyrim with a little extra stability and flair.

I used Skyrim Modding Essentials as a base to make this list so full credit to Phenderix for that list.

# Before You Start

Before you dive in, there's a couple things you need to be sure of first:

<br>

## Hardware Requirements

I run a relatively powerful PC with the following specs:
  * CPU: i7 13700KF
  * RAM: 32GB 
  * GPU: RX 7900 XTX

That being said this list should run relatively well on most modern PC's if you are really struggling with performance you should just be able to disable community shaders and run the list fine.

You will need at least `70GB` of disk space on a drive for the installation. For the downloads, you will need an extra `20GB`- ideally you want *at least* `180GB` for temporary Wabbajack work space.
I am unable to test the list on an HDD so I would recommend and SSD for load speeds.

## Accounts

In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account

Whilst you don't *need* a Nexus premium account to install the modlist, you'll have a considerably better time of it if you do.
